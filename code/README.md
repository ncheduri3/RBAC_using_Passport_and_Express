This is an exceprt of the contribution that I made to the project NORP. I am resusing the readme file from the project NORP - a bigdata management and anayltics tool for non profit research. 

Code organization:
- Frontend code in `./src` folder
- Backend code in `./server` folder

To run both the frontend and backend hosted on same server, do the following steps-
- Ensure installed node version `16.14.1` or higher


 `npm i`

 `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) 

#API routes
All API routes using Express can be controlled in `./server/server.js`.
